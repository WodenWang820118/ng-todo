# Overview

The application is the practice of to-do app lists using Angular. It is initially created by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia). The purpose of the repository is to familiarize the basics of Angular, such as:

1. Typescript with class instances component.
2. Passing properties to the child component.
3. Basic framework shorthand form directive: *ngIf, *ngFor="[let item in items]" syntax.
4. Basic routing.
5. Basic HTTP request, response with `HttpClient` module in any kind of `services`; the `Observable` and the `Subscription` pattern to handle the response.
6. Basic custom event handling with `EventEmitter` and `Output` in the `component`, and how the event is passed and dealt with parent component with `services`.
