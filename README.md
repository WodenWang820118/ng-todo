# Overview
The application is the practice of to-do app lists using Angular. It is initially created by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia). The purpose of the repository is to familiarize the basics of Angular, such as:
1. Typescript with class instances component.
2. Passing properties to the child component.
3. Basic framework shorthand form directive: *ngIf, *ngFor="[let item in items]" syntax.
4. Basic routing.
5. Basic HTTP request, response with `HttpClient` module in any kind of `services`; the `Observable` and the `Subscription` pattern to handle the response.
6. Basic custom event handling with `EventEmitter` and `Output` in the `component`, and how the event is passed and dealt with parent component with `services`.

Overall, the repository adds the comments if the code includes the concepts of Angular under each component. The gentle explanations and references are for the Angular beignners to understand and track the code. Extra implementations will focus on the unit-testing into three sections:
- the class behaviors
- the DOM rendering
- the routing test which ensure the correct routing path directing to the expected component.

# Testing
- to run a unit test on a specific component, for example, `ng -include src/app/components/about/about.component.spec.ts`.
- the test mentioned above is implemented as an example of the unit test.

# Plan
- to implement more unit tests.
